			<h2> Background </h2>
			<p> I am passionate about travelling to find out about new trends in the hospitality world, but more over about restauration. Having had the opportunity to obtain an internship in the Marriott offices in Hong-Kong, in the design and operations development department, I was able to further develop my skills and assert my passion for the creation of new concepts in the hotel world, mixing design, creativity and real estate.</p>

Then for my operational internship after the preparatory year at Ehl, i went to London to work as a front desk assistant. Last year, i had the opportunity to go to Hong-Kong to work as a design and development intern for bars and restaurants in Marriott International offices. </p>
